# Smooshed Potatoes

Preparation time: one hour

## Ingredients

(measures are all approximate and not critical - vary to taste)

* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1/2 tspn dried thyme
* 1/2 tspn finely chopped garlic (from a jar in fine)
* 2lb Yukon Gold potatoes

## Method

Pre-heat an oven to hot, 425F. Boil the potatoes in their skins for about 15-20 minutes until just cooked. Meanwhile mix together the olive oil, chopped garlic and dried thyme. Drain the potatoes and place them on a baking sheet. Using the back of a spoon, gently smoosh the potatoes so the skins break but they don't fall apart. Drizzle and brush the olive oil mixture onto the potatoes. Roast the potatoes for about 20 to 25 minutes until crisp.
