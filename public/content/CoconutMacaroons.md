# Coconut Macaroons

## Ingredients

* 3 egg whites
* 1 packet of sweetened coconut flakes
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon almond essence
* 1/4 teaspoon vanilla essence
* pinch of salt
* 6oz semi-sweet chocolate

## Method

Pre-heat an oven to 375F. Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks and whisk in the essences. Meanwhile whizz the other ingredients (except the chocolate) in the food processor for about 30 seconds. Fold the dry ingredients into the beaten egg whites. Using wet hands, form golf ball size spheres and place them on a large (prepared) baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes until beginning to turn golden brown. Cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Once cool, melt the chocolate in a double boiler and half coat each macaroon. Leave to cool.
