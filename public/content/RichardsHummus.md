# Hummus

I started with [this recipe](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/15938/easy-and-smooth-hummus-recipe/), which has a great texture, but I was never happy with the flavor. I'm really not the biggest tahini fan, which means adapting any recipe for my tastes. I'm currently working with the version below, adapted from *Cook's Illustrated's* "The Science of Good Cooking" p.265.

## Ingredients

1 can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 small garlic clove, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
Pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 lemon
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 (3?) tablespoons of olive oil

## Method

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the chickpeas and spices and blitz for 15 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. With the processor running, slowly drizzle in the lemon juice and water. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again. With the processor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil, ofrming an emulsion.
Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Serve hummus with a drizzle of olive oil and dash of paprika. Store homemade hummus in an airtight container and refrigerate up to one week.
