# Gazpacho

## Ingredients

Note: this recipe is very lenient; use what you have and adjust to taste.

* a large tin of tomatoes - ideally Italian. In an ideal world you would use perfectly ripe fresh tomatoes. If miraculously you can get hold of them, use those instead.
* 1 cucumber, peeled and seeded then chopped
* 1 bell pepper, chopped
* 1/2 red onion, chopped
* 1 chile pepper e.g. a jalapeno, chopped
* 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt
* 1 thick slice of bread
* 1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil
* 1 tablespoon of sherry vinegar
* black pepper

## Method

Add all the chopped vegetables into a bowl with the salt and stir. Leave for a hour or so; a lot of water will have been released, toss in the bread. Leave it out for another hour or two. Liquidize in two batches. As each batch purees, slowly drizzle in half the olive oil so that it forms an emulsion. Place all the soup in a container and stir in the vinegar and black pepper. Refridgerate overnight. Will keep for several days.
