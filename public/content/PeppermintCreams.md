# Peppermint Creams

Since the tragic demise of Maynard-Bassett's Mint Creams I've had to fall back on my own devices.

## Ingredients

up to 450g icing sugar
caster sugar
peppermint essence
a drop of lemon juice
one egg white

## Method

Beat one egg white until it starts to foam.
Add a drop of lemon juice and mix thoroughly.
Sift in 400g icing sugar.
Add 1/2 tspn of peppermint essence.
Bring together with a wooden spoon, then gently knead into a soft dough.
Transfer to a surface dusted with icing sugar and roll out to about a 1cm thickness.
Cut out using a pastry cutter.
Leave mints to dry on a non-stick sheet.

## Discussion

400g as recommended by Jamie is too much for one ickle egg white to bind. Start with 200-250.

### testing round one

#### recipe

1.25 egg whites
100g regular sugar
300g powdered sugar
1tsp peppermint essence

#### feedback

a little more crunchy than melty
a little soapy - something in the peppermint essence adding a floral, soapy nose.
peppermint strength high, good
outer texture should be drier, inner texture softer

### testing round two

#### recipe

1 egg white
250g powdered sugar
1tsp peppermint essence (the new one)
sugar for dipping

#### method

made the creams as per usual. when dryish, dipped in a mint syrup then in sugar.

#### feedback

too soft in the center.
the syrup dip and sugar coat was a messy, inconsistent affair.
the new peppermint essence was not nearly as strong, but tasted better overall.
the look was unacceptable.
