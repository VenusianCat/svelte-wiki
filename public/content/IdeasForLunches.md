## Lunch ideas

* Soups; bring bread or grab it from grand central.
  * chicken
  * cream of tomato
  * cream of asparagus
  * curried corn
* bag salads can work plus chicken salad leftovers?
* sandwich / wrap fillings; grab a baguette from a bakery?
  * e.g. chicken salad; pork fillet slices with mustard mayo and arugula
* yoghurt, lemon curd and cereal
* pizza from the pizza window ($4)
* curry
* chicken chasseur / coq au vin (what's the difference?)
* chicken tikka based wraps. prep chicken tikka and defrost sauce on Monday night, curry on Tuesday, leftovers all week long!
