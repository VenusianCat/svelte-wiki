# Key Lime Pie

## Ingredients

### Filling

the zest and 1/2 cup juice from 3 large limes
4 egg yolks
1 can sweetened condensed milk

### Crust

11 graham crackers (6 ounces)
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
6 tablespoons butter

### Topping

3/4 cup heavy cream

## Method

* Heat the oven to 325F.
* Whisk the zest and yolks together and leave for a couple of minutes for the zest to tint the mixture green.
* Beat in the condensed milk, then the lime juice. Leave to thicken (about 30 minutes).
* Meanwhile, process the graham crackers until evenly fine. Add the sugar and pulse to combine. Continue to pulse while adding the melted butter in a steady stream. The mixture should resemble wet sand.
* Transfer the crumbs to a 9" pie dish and press the crumbs evenly with the base of a 1/2 cup measuring cup to form the base. Bake until fragrant and beginning to brown, ~15 minutes.
* Pour the filling into the crust. Bake until the center is set, yet still wiggly when jigged, 15-17 minutes.
* Allow to cool, then refridgerate.
* Whip the cream until it forms stiff peaks, then spread it over the pie.
