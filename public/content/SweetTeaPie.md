# Sweet Tea Pie

I discovered this pie when visiting Austin, Texas for SXSW at Lucy's Fried Chicken just off S Congress. Being new to the South I assumed this to be standard southern fare, only to discover it's a hyperlocal delicacy. It's essentially a custard pie, extremely rich and toothsome, slightly finicky to cook.

The recipe here is adapted from [the source](http://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/sweet-tea-pie.html) for a regular size pie dish and uses half the original recipe's suggested amount of filling.

### Ingredients

1 pie crust - however you fancy
6 egg yolks
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup very strong black tea
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon cornflour
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
Whipped cream, for serving

### Directions

1. Make a pie crust however you fancy. Or buy one. Fold the overhanging edges back onto themselves and crimp to form a half-inch barrier above the pan. Consider 5 or 10 minutes of a blind bake to avoid a soggy button; alternatively refrigerate until ready to fill and bake.
2. Preheat the fan oven to 325 degrees F. (thinking - try 300)
3. For the filling: Add the egg yolks to a large mixing bowl. Slowly pour in the sugar, whisking constantly, until thoroughly combined. Whisk in the lemon juice and tea. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, cornmeal and salt, then whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients.
4. Set the mixing bowl over a barely simmering saucepan of water and heat the filling slowly, whisking often. Gradually whisk in the butter until fully combined. Pour the filling into the chilled pie shell.
5. Bake on the middle rack of the oven until the surface of the pie turns deep brown and hardens slightly and the center jiggles but doesn't ripple, about 30 minutes; start checking after 25 minutes. You're basically making a custard which is a bit of a dangerous game... you want the thing to set but you musn't allow it to boil or it will split and there goes your pie and your evening. And a whole lot of eggs. I test the center with a instant read thermometer and pull it out when it gets to 200Â°F.
6. Let the pie cool completely on a rack, then refrigerate for easy slicing. Enjoy cool or at room temperature. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream.
