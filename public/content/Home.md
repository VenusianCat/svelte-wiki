## Things I love to eat occassionally but probably shouldn't cook a whole one
- black forest gateaux


## Other recipes attempted

- lemon curd (I overcooked it)
- bakewell tart (way too sweet)
- tempura asparagus (massive fail)
- north african eggs (fine) (GR p146)
- tomato soup (better the second time; needed to reduce)
- dutch carmel apple pie (very good but couldn't eat it all)
- [Jollof Rice](https://tasty.co/recipe/ghanaian-jollof-rice-as-made-by-tei-hammond) - produced 2 or 3 times; finicky to cook through; I think not worth the effort.
- [Tahini](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/26901/easy-tahini-recipe/) - way better than store bought, but I'm just not a tahini fan and tend to omit it from my hummus.
- [chicken vindaloo](https://www.food.com/recipe/chicken-vindaloo-177572) - meh, an admirable attempt to make a curry in an hour, but just not as good...
