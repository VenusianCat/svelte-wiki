# Curried Corn Soup

## Ingredients

* olive oil
* 1 onion peeled and finely diced
* 1 large potato peeled and cubed
* 1 quart vegetable or chicken stock
* Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
* One 15-ounce can creamed corn
* One 15-ounce can corn kernels

### For the curry paste

* 1 Tbsp. coriander seeds
* 1 Tbsp. cumin seeds
* 2 garlic cloves peeled and crushed
* 1 tsp chili powder = way too much
* 1 tsp ground turmeric
* 2 tsp peeled and chopped fresh ginger
* 1/2 tsp sea salt
* olive oil

## Method

1. First make the curry paste. Toast the coriander and cumin seeds in a dry, medium-hot frying pan for about 1 minute until aromatic. Grind in a mortar to a fine powder, then add the garlic and grind to form a smooth paste. Add the chili powder, turmeric, ginger, and salt and mix well. Loosen by adding a little oil.

2. To make the soup, heat a large oiled saucepan over medium heat. Sweat the onion for 5 minutes until soft but not colored. Add the curry paste and cook with the onion for about 2 minutes until aromatic. Add the potato and stir around in the curry paste. Pour in the stock, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer gently for about 7 minutes until the potato is soft and cooked through.

3. Add the creamed corn, then add half the can of corn kernels and half the liquid they are stored in. Heat through, then remove from the heat and blend with a stick blender until the chunks of potatoes have been fully broken down and the soup is smooth. Add the remaining canned corn and its liquid. Heat, taste, and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Serve warm.
