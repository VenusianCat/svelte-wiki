# Pita Bread

makes 8 pitas

## Ingredients

2 cups all purpose flour (plus a little more for dusting)
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp olive oil
1 packet of instant yeast
1 cup warm water

## Instructions

* Combine the all-purpose flour, wheat flour, salt and sugar in a mixing bowl. Stir to mix.
* Add the yeast to the warm water and stir to dissolve completely. Pour this into the mixing bowl along with olive oil and then combine everything into a sticky mass.
* Knead in the stand mixer with the bread hook for 5 minutes or so until it comes together as a unified ball of slightly sticky dough. If it's super sticky, add another teaspoon of flour and knead some more etc.
* Lightly oil the same mixing bowl. Transfer the dough into it, coat it with olive oil from all sides to dissuade it from drying and then leave it to prove in a warm place for 2 hours.
* Deflate the proved dough. (At this point you can put it in tupperware and in the fridge for several days. It only seems to get better at puffing over time.)
* Once your ready to cook it, cut off an eighth of the dough and tuck the sides in of it to give it a round shape. Optionally leave it for a few more minutes (perhaps while you make sme more rounds).
* Heat a dry skillet on your hottest burner. Because you've watched Dark Waters, do not use a non-stick pan.
* Using flour to prevent it sticking, roll out your cute little dough ball **as thinly as possible**.
* Carefully place your flat dough circle into your skillet which should, by this point, be smoking hot. Seriously, it has to be as hot as possible.
* if you've done everything right the dough should puffs up like a balloon in about a minute. Flip it over again to cook on both sides.
* If making several, wrap them in a tea towel as soon as they comes out of the skillet to keep them soft.
