# svelte-wiki

## Caution Advised

This is a personal project; no guarantees or even vague intimations of quality provided! I built this to better learn Svelte, it no doubt contains many rookie errors, inefficiencies, poor coding decisions etc.

## What is this?

SvelteWiki is a single page app designed to produce a personal standalone wiki.

In its current, completely use-case-specific implementation it's set up to help me organize my recipes.

In time, I will document this. Yes, I know you've heard that before.

## Dependencies / Included Code

* [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) - a JavaScript library to parse markdown
* php to manage backend storage; all data is stored in markdown files on the filesystem
